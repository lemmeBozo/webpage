			<h2 class="article-headers">Career Goals</h2>
			<p>
				Hello everyone, my career aspirations revolve around the field of 
				Computer Science, which spans from its theoretical foundations to 
				related areas such as front-end website design. While I haven't 
				pinpointed my exact career path yet, one certainty I hold is that 
				it will be coding-related. I'm particularly enthusiastic about a 
				range of possibilities within this domain, including Web Design, 
				Game Development, Software Engineering, Mobile App Development, 
				and more. My interests in these areas reflect my eagerness to 
				explore the diverse and exciting realms that Computer Science 
				has to offer.
			</p>
			<h2 class="article-headers">What I know about web design so far</h2>
			<p>
				This class has been an incredible journey so far, and I've gained 
				a wealth of knowledge in web design. I've delved into various aspects,
				primarily focusing on HTML, where I've learned both the basic elements 
				and the importance of semantic ones like header, article, nav, and more. 
				Understanding these elements not only enhances the structure of your CSS 
				but also streamlines it, making it more organized and concise. My coding 
				skills have undeniably improved since I started working with HTML and CSS.
			</p>

			<p>		
				In my journey through programming languages, C++ has emerged as my absolute 
				favorite. While I initially began with JavaScript and explored Java and C++ 
				during my courses at Diablo Valley College and San Joaquin Delta College, 
				C++ has always stood out due to its versatility, simplicity, and speed.

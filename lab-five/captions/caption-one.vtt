00:00.100 --> 00:04.999
Lonely, ever since I made it back from Hell

2
00:05.100 --> 00:08.999
Whoever said it's better to love and lose someone

3
00:08.999 --> 00:10.999
Never lost themselves

4
00:11.999 --> 00:14.999
Once you think you know me

5
00:14.999 --> 00:18.999
I change everything about myself

6
00:18.999 --> 00:21.999
But there's nowhere to run when it comes to you

7
00:21.999 --> 00:24.999
All my camouflage melts

8
00:24.999 --> 00:30.999
And suddenly, I'm see-through

9
00:31.999 --> 00:37.999
Whenever I see you

10
00:37.999 --> 00:38.999
It's true

11
00:39.500 --> 00:42.999
Glass, ice, white lace

12
00:42.999 --> 00:45.999
Won't hide my face

13
00:45.999 --> 00:52.999
I'm see-through for you, for you

14
00:55.999 --> 00:57.500
See through all of my windows tinted

15
00:57.500 --> 00:58.999
You lookin' at me with that x-ray vision

16
00:58.999 --> 01:00.500
Like skeletons in my closet, I hid 'em

17
01:00.500 --> 01:02.500
Right next to the t-shirt you takin' off me

18
01:02.500 --> 01:03.500
Takin' off all of my cellophane

19
01:03.500 --> 01:05.500
Touchin' on everything (Everything, everything, everything)

20
01:05.500 --> 01:07.000
What you want, what you need

21
01:07.000 --> 01:09.500
You could have it all, the way you look at me

22
01:09.500 --> 01:14.500
Look at me (Look at me), the way you look at me (Look at me), yeah

23
01:14.500 --> 01:19.500
Suddenly, I'm see-through

24
01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
Whenever I see you

25
01:26.500 --> 01:28.000
it's true

26
01:28.500 --> 01:31.500
Glass, ice, white lace

27
01:31.500 --> 01:34.500
Won't hide my face

28
01:34.500 --> 01:41.500
I'm see-through for you, for you

29
02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Nobody, nobody, nobody

30
02:22.500 --> 02:25.500
See me like you do

31
02:26.500 --> 02:28.500
Nobody, nobody, nobody

32
02:28.500 --> 02:32.000
See me like you do

33
02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Nobody, nobody, nobody

34
02:35.500 --> 02:38.500
See me like you do

35
02:39.500 --> 02:41.500
Nobody, nobody, nobody

36
02:41.500 --> 02:45.000
See me like you do

37
02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Nobody, nobody, nobody

38
02:48.500 --> 02:51.500
See me like you do

39
02:52.500 --> 02:54.500
Nobody, nobody, nobody

40
02:54.500 --> 02:58.000
See me like you do
